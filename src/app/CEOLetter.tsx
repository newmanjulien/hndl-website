                Work is insane. You might have a boss who&apos;s hard to deal
                with. Or demanding customers. Or you might just have ambitious
                KPIs you need to hit
              </p>

              <p>
                Which is why you can&apos;t afford for your personal life to be
                just as busy
              </p>

              <p>
                But lets be honest. Your personal life is just as busy as your
                work
              </p>

              <p>
                You might have a large home you need to take care of. Aging
                parents. Or you might have kids who need you. And what&apos;s
                for sure is that there&apos;s at least some paperwork which you
                just don&apos;t have time to get to
              </p>
